created a automatic blind if person is detected in room
# Automated Blinds for Halls (Arduino Project)

An Arduino-powered system to automatically control window blinds in large halls based on **light intensity**, **time schedule**, and **people presence detection**.  
Perfect for auditoriums, classrooms, and conference halls to improve **energy efficiency** and **comfort**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- **Automatic Light Sensing** â€“ Adjusts blinds based on ambient light using an LDR sensor.
- **People Detection** â€“ Uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect human presence and activate blinds only when needed.
- **Scheduled Operation** â€“ Opens/closes blinds at specific times of the day.
- **Manual Override** â€“ Control blinds via push buttons or remote.
- **Low Power Consumption** â€“ Energy-efficient design.
- **Customizable Settings** â€“ Thresholds and timings can be adjusted in code.
